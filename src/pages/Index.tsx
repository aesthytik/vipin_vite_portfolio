                Hey! With over 5 years of building apps, I love mixing AI with
                frontend development to create some really cool stuff. With
                expert React and Next.js skills in my toolkit, what really gets
                me excited is making AI actually useful in real-world apps. I
                hack around with blockchain tech too - built some fun DApps and
                smart contracts. When I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me
                tinkering with new AI models or breaking (and fixing!) things in
                Web3 space.
