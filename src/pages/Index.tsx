                Currently working as a Software Engineer at Nuelo, I bring over
                5 years of experience specializing in sophisticated web
                applications with AI integration. At Nuelo, I create web-based
                solutions while maintaining high performance and accessibility
                standards. I leverage my expertise in React and Next.js to
                develop enterprise-grade solutions. My passion lies in
                implementing practical AI solutions in production environments,
                and I have a proven track record of architecting scalable
                applications. I also explore blockchain technology, developing
                DApps and smart contracts. Beyond coding, I'm deeply involved in
                AI research and actively contribute to the Web3 ecosystem.
